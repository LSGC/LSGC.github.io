			<i>	Hendrik Nolte, Simon Hernan Sarmiento Sabater, Tim Ehlers and Julian Kunkel</i>
			<br><br>
			Driven by the progress of data and compute-intensive methods in various scientific domains, there is an increasing demand from researchers working with highly sensitive data to have access to the necessary computational resources to be able to adapt those methods in their respective fields. To satisfy the computing needs of those researchers in a cost-effective way, it is an open quest to integrate reliable security measures on existing High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. The fundamental problem to securely work with sensitive data is, that HPC systems are shared systems that are typically trimmed for highest performance – not for high security. For instance, there are commonly no additional virtualization techniques employed, thus, users typically have access to the host operating system. Since new vulnerabilities are being continuously discovered, solely relying on the traditional Unix permissions is not secure enough. In this paper, we discuss a generic and secure workflow that can be implemented on typical HPC systems allowing users to transfer, store and analyze sensitive data. In our experiments, we see an advantage in the asynchronous execution of IO requests, while reaching 80% of the ideal performance.

			<h4 id="empaia">The EMPAIA Platform: Vendor-neutral integration of AI applications into digital pathology infrastructures</h4>
			<i>Christoph Jansen, Klaus Strohmenger, Daniel Romberg, Tobias Küster, Nick Weiss, Björn Lindequist, Michael Franz, André Homeyer and Norman Zerbe</i>
			<br><br>
			Automated image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) are a growing market in digital pathology. While various proprietary pathology systems exist, there are no fully vendor-agnostic integration approaches for AI apps. This makes it difficult for vendors of AI solutions to integrate their products into the multitude of non-standard software systems in pathology. The EMPAIA Consortium (EcosysteM for Pathology Diagnostics with AI Assistance) develops an open and decentralized platform allowing AI-based apps of different vendors to be integrated with existing lab IT infrastructures. This is intended to lower the barriers to entry for AI vendors and provide pathologists with access to advanced AI tools. The EMPAIA platform is based on web technologies that can be deployed both on-premises and in the cloud. There are open-source reference implementations for core platform services that can be integrated with or replaced by proprietary alternatives as long as they conform to open API specifications. Apps can be
obtained through a central marketplace so pathologists can use them in their daily workflow. In this paper, we provide an overview of the EMPAIA platform
architecture. We identify critical use cases and requirements for AI-based software platforms in pathology and explain how these are fulfilled by the EMPAIA platform. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of routing image data through the platform.

			<h4 id="selfadaption">On the building of self-adaptable systems to efficiently manage medical data</h4>
			<i>Genaro Sanchez-Gallegos, Dante Sánchez-Gallegos, Jose Luis Gonzalez-Compean and Jesus Carretero</i>
			<br><br>
			he systems that meet non-functional requirements (NFRs) are key for e-health services to face up events such as
service outages and violations of confidentiality. However, traditional NFR systems produce efficiency issues, which, when arising in runtime, could affect e-health decision-making processes. This paper presents a dynamic parallel pattern construction model to design and create efficient NFR self-adaptable systems. These patterns include two design phases: in the first one, the designers build NFR systems by creating pipelines including as many
applications as required to meet the NFRs established by organizations. In the second phase, the pipelines are automatically added to a dynamic pattern in the form of workers to improve the performance of the NFR systems. The dynamic patterns include services that recursively and automatically perform performance diagnosis and modifications in the parallel version of the NFR system to face, in runtime, changes in the incoming workload. A prototype was implemented to create self-adaptable NFR systems, which were used in a case study to manage spirometry studies, tomography images, and electrocardiograms. The evaluation showed the effectiveness of this dynamic pattern model to create self-adaptable systems for processing multiple types of health data. The evaluation also revealed that the self-adaptive NFR systems built by dynamic patterns yielded significant performance gain in a direct comparison with the implementation of NFR application pipelines built by a traditional framework called Jenkins.

                   	<h4 id="collaboration">On distributed collaboration for biomedical analyses</h4>
			<i>Fatima-Zahra Boujdad, Alban Gaignard, Mario Südholt, Wilmer Garzón Alfonso, Luis Daniel Benavides Navarro and Richard Redon</i>
			<br><br>
			SCooperation of research groups is nowadays common for the development and execution of biomedical analyses. Multiple partners contribute data in this context, data that is often centralized for processing at some cluster-based or supercomputer-based infrastructure. In contrast, real distributed collaboration that involves processing of data from several partners at different sites is rare. However, such distributed analyses are often very interesting, in particular, for scalability, security and privacy reasons.

In this article, we motivate the need for real distributed biomedical analyses in the context of several on-going projects, including the I-CAN project that involves 34 French hospitals and affiliated research groups. We present a set of distributed architectures for such analyses that we have derived from discussions with four different medical research groups and a study of related work. These architectures allow for scalability, security/privacy and reproducibility issues to be taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how such architectures can be implemented with specific tools from computer science and bioinformatics.

			<h4 id="sciencegateway">Towards a Science Gateway for Bioinformatics: Experiences in the Brazilian System of High Performance Computing</h4>
			<i>Kary Ocaña, Marcelo Galheigo, Carla Osthoff, Luiz Gadelha, Antônio Tadeu A. Gomes, Daniel de Oliveira, Fabio Porto and Ana Tereza Vasconelos​</i>
			<br><br>
			Science gateways bring out the possibility of reproducible science as they are integrated to reusable techniques, data and workflow management systems, security mechanisms, and high performance computing (HPC). We introduce Bioinfo-Portal, a science gateway that executes bioinformatics applications using HPC and data management resources provided by the Brazilian National HPC System (SINAPAD). BioinfoPortal follows the Software as a Service (SaaS) model and it is freely available for academic use. Overall, this paper addresses an investigation on some of HPC features in the BioinfoPortal gateway system and analyzes of their impacts. We analyzed the scalability of RAxML in HPC clusters and general features from application executions (dataset, software parameters, efficiency of machines capacity) using machine learning techniques for predicting the effective allocation/usage of computational resources for the gateway. The machine-learning strategies appoint the best machine setup in a heterogeneous environment for the executions of applications that presented at least 75% of efficiency.​

			<h4 id="keynote2">Towards data intensive aware programming models for Exascale systems</h4>
			<i>Javier Garcia Blas​</i>
			<br><br>
			Extreme Data is an incarnation of Big Data concept distinguished by the massive amounts of data that must be queried, communicated and analyzed in (near) real-time by using a very large number of memory/storage elements and Exascale computing systems. Immediate examples are the scientific data produced at a rate of hundreds of gigabits-per-second that must be stored, filtered and analyzed, the millions of images per day that must be mined (analyzed) in parallel, the one billion of social data posts queried in real-time on an in-memory components database. Traditional disks or commercial storage cannot handle nowadays the extreme scale of such application data.

Following the need of improvement of current concepts and technologies, ASPIDE’s activities focus on data-intensive applications running on systems composed of up to millions of computing elements (Exascale systems). Practical results will include the methodology and software prototypes that will be designed and used to implement Exascale applications.
The ASPIDE project will contribute with the definition of a new programming paradigms, APIs, runtime tools and methodologies for expressing data-intensive tasks on Exascale systems, which can pave the way for the exploitation of massive parallelism over a simplified model of the system architecture, promoting high performance and efficiency, and offering powerful operations and mechanisms for processing extreme data sources at high speed and/or real-time.

			<h4 id="bigdata">Big Data Analytics Exploration of Green Space and Mental Health in Melbourne</h4>
			<i>Richard Sinnott and Ying Hu</i>
			<br><br>
			Numerous researchers have shown that urban green space, e.g. parks and gardens, is positively associated with health and general well-being. However, these works are typically based on surveys that have many limitations related to the sample size and the questionnaire design. Social media offers the possibility to systematically assess how human emotion is impacted by access to green space at a far larger scale that is more representative of society. In this paper, we explore how Twitter data was used to explore the relationship between green space and human emotion (sentiment). We consider the relationship between Twitter sentiment and green space in the suburbs of Melbourne and consider the impact of socio-economics and related demographic factors. We develop a linear model to explore the extent that access to green space has on the sentiment of tweeters..​
